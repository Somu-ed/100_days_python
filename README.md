# 100 Days of Python

This repository will come to contain 100 python projects ranging from **Beginner** to **Professional** which will be an addition to my portfolio.
While these projects' ideas will come from a Udemy course they'll differ according to my personal understanding and tastes.

## Content

1. **Day001** - *Band Name Generator*

## Descriptions

1. **Day001**
: Day-1 consisted of print(), string manipulation, input() and variables & their naming sense. I made a simple **band name generator** project which encapsulated all the components learnt in Day-1. The project takes in the name of a *city* and *pet*, And concats both the strings to give a possible *band name*.
