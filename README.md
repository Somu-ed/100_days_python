## Descriptions

### Day001
Day-1 consisted of print(), string manipulation, input() and variables & their naming sense.

I made a simple **band name generator** project which encapsulated all the components learnt in Day-1. The project takes in the name of a *city* and *pet*, And concats both the strings to give a possible *band name*.

### Day002
Day-2 consisted of Data Types, Type conversion, Arithmatic operations, Number manipulation and F-Strings.

I wrote two programs using these concepts **BMI calculator** and **Your life in weeks**. I also made a **tip calculator** project which took in the *total bill*, t*ip percentage*(10, 12, or 15) and the *number of people* to return the *money paid by each person* rounded to 2 decimal places.
